    <h1>Find Love or Die Trying</h1>
    <p>note: page unfinished</p>
        <p>Over the past year or two I've been recommended by a lot of people to give FLoDT a try, and I recently finally found the time to. The story was pretty predictable for the most part, and the characters just aren't really given the time to develop. Art and music was rather forgettable. I also hate the fake choices the game give you, there's a hundred of them and only like 3 actually matter. Definitely not worth it, even for a free VN (unless you cannot stand furry VNs, in which case this might be worth it but that's mainly your fault).</p>
