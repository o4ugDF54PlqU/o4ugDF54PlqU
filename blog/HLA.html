    <h1>Half Life Alyx</h1>
    <p>It's Half Life, but in VR, expect linear corridors and physics puzzles. That wouldn't be so bad on its own, except the game forces you to scavenge for ammo and supplies so a third of your playtime is just searching drawers and shelves which gets boring pretty quick. This also means you don't really get to have fun with your guns until the final chapters, which is a shame since the guns are pretty fun to use. </p>
