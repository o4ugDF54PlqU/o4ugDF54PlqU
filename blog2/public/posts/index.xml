      <description>TLDR Shinji got in the robot but it took 35 hours and we had to listen to his every stray thought. This VN is the epitome of tell don&amp;rsquo;t show. Buy only if you are 14 and think an hour long internal monologue about obeying orders is deep. tbf you&amp;rsquo;re getting a lot of decent animations and a typical but not bad mecha anime story here, but I wish I could have spent those 30 hours playing a better visual novel that respects my time (the other 10 hours is pretty good tho).</description>

      <description>Over the past year or two I&amp;rsquo;ve been recommended by a lot of people to give FLoDT a try, and I recently finally found the time to. The story was pretty predictable for the most part, and the characters just aren&amp;rsquo;t really given the time to develop. Art and music was rather forgettable. I also hate the fake choices the game give you, there&amp;rsquo;s a hundred of them and only like 3 actually matter.</description>

      <title>Half Life Alyx</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Half Life, but in VR, expect linear corridors and physics puzzles. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so bad on its own, except the game forces you to scavenge for ammo and supplies so a third of your playtime is just searching drawers and shelves which gets boring pretty quick. This also means you don&amp;rsquo;t really get to have fun with your guns until the final chapters, which is a shame since the guns are pretty fun to use.</description>

      <title>XCOM Chimera Squad Review</title>

      <description>TLDR Chimera Squad is for you if you save scummed in the other XCOM games so that nobody dies.&#xA;Full Review If XCOM 2 is a full three course meal, then Chimera Squad is drive thru burger and fries. It&amp;rsquo;s not as deep or as fleshed out as 2, but sometimes you just want the burger. Chimera Squad is what happens when you take XCOM 2 and repackage it to be played in short bursts.</description>
