Over the past year or two I've been recommended by a lot of people to give FLoDT a try, and I recently finally found the time to. The story was pretty predictable for the most part, and the characters just aren't really given the time to develop. Art and music was rather forgettable. I also hate the fake choices the game give you, there's a hundred of them and only like 3 actually matter. 

So I was very confused on why people were hyping this game up so much, and from what I can tell it's mainly because it's free. Even for a free VN, FLoDT isn't worth your time. There are way better free VNs that deserve your time, like Echo, Remember the Flowers, Adastra, etc. Though these are all furry VNs, I can't think of any good free anime VNs so I guess it makes more sense that people would drool over this game. But if you can't stand furry VNs then that's mainly your fault.
