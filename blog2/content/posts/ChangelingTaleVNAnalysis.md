A visual novel masterpiece that anyone remotely interested in the medium should play. There's an option to turn off adult content too if you're not into that. The rest of this review is a deep dive 10000 words analysis of the visual novel medium and storytelling.

Changeling Tale was the visual novel that got me into visual novels, when I discovered it years ago. Visual novels are able to combine the best of the novel world and the the best of the visual media world (movies, shows, comics). 

It is my opinion that stories should be about characters. The events and the world should serve to develop the characters not the other way around. An interesting world alone will keep your mind engaged for maybe a couple months, but an interesting character that you can share emotions with will stick with your heart for the rest of your life. But in order to have a unique three dimensional character you can relate with the story must be long enough for their development. This is where the medium of novels can shine.

Novels are great because they can be very long. A novel is cheap to create relative to the amount of time it takes to finish one. All you need is a person with a keyboard and a computer and if you're a YA novel author you can crank one out in a couple weeks (not that you should). It takes me around 5-8 hours to finish a 300 page novel which I postulate is also the minimum amount of time it takes to emotionally bond with a fictional character written by an above average writer. Part of this is psychological (kind of like Stockholm Syndrome :thonk:) but most of it is that it is easiest to empathize with someone who we spend a lot of time with and could see many events through their eyes. This is the second advantage of novels: showing characters' thoughts.

 also have the advantage over other mediums with showing characters' thoughts. Of course, these thoughts could backfire and alienate writers with an incompetent writer (see: [Muv Luv Alternative](https://o4ugdf54plqu.github.io/blog2/public/posts/mla/))

That said, their stories must still be concise.

(note: I have not finished any of the routes since I was waiting for the steam release to binge the rest)
