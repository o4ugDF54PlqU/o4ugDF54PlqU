# TLDR
Shinji got in the robot but it took 35 hours and we had to listen to his every stray thought. This VN is the epitome of tell don't show. Buy only if you are 14 and think an hour long internal monologue about obeying orders is deep. tbf you're getting a lot of decent animations and a typical but not bad mecha anime story here, but I wish I could have spent those 30 hours playing a better visual novel that respects my time (the other 10 hours is pretty good tho).

# Full Review
Note: contains minor spoilers

MLA is a story about finding yourself. A story about purpose and determination, about friendship and camaraderie. Set in a post-apocalypse world. The game opens up with Takeru, who finds himself back in time in this post-apocalypse. I never played ML but the game has quite a few flashbacks to help you fill in the blanks. 

On paper, it sounds amazing. However the many details of the story reveals a lack of focus. One moment on the front lines, next moment it's time travel, then it returns to romance. Jack of all trades nature hurts it. Does not truly excel at any one thing. 

Where it really falls apart though, is the main protagonist. If you are like Takeru, then you might love MLA. I am nothing like Takeru and he came off as immature and whiny throughout most of the game. It also doesn't help that we get to hear basically his every stray thought. It's like if Shinji got in the robot and then has a mental breakdown and we're stuck inside his head, hearing about how scared he is and how scary the angels are and the implications of the angels being here and what the weather is like today. The writers obviously have never heard of show don't tell. And when Takeru finally stops thinking and starts speaking, we get a lecture from him or he gets lectured by someone else.

While there is a healthy dose of political intruige, it's nothing too spectacular for the military scifi genre.

The writing is adequate, though the pacing drops to a crawl at times for absolutely no reason. This is most apparent whenever Takeru decides to stop whatever he is doing and start an internal monologue on a I-am-14-and-this-is-deep topic. For example at one point he spends several paragraphs talking in his head about how militaries must have an organizational structure in order to be effective. Other characters aren't as bad, but they all speak in the typical anime or manga way where everyone has a 30 minute dialogue in the middle of a fight about incredibly obvious things.

Speaking of other characters, they started off interesting but became bland by the end. Flaws are superficial and are pretty much resolved halfway through.

Animations are distracting and rarely add to the experience. Voice acting is pretty good, but a bit too slow. Tried to let them speak but ended up skipping to speed things up. Music has some great tracks, but most are pretty forgettable even by royalty free music standards.

There are choices, but they basically don't matter. Which is a bit disappointing imo.

Perhaps revolutionary for the time, but simply can't compete with today's standards. I had the most fun with the slice of life segments. The game falls flat when it tries to be more serious.
